/* 
Pitch
you have to take a picture of someone committing a crime at the right moment
a short animated scene will play with the player looking on from a far away distance
there will be many npcs in the scene to make the player really have tolook, as the crime will be subtle
if you take a good picture you move on to the next level and earn intuition points
if you miss the picture you fail the level and have to restart

player can go into camera mode to take a picture but can walk around the scene in normal top-down fashion.
